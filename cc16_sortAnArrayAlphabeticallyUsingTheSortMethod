function alphabeticalOrder(arr) {
  // Add your code below this line
  return arr.sort(function(a,b) {
    return a > b
  })
  
  // Add your code above this line
}
alphabeticalOrder(["a", "d", "c", "a", "z", "g"]);

//The solution is as easy as just using the method like so: 'return arr.sort()' but it's good practice to provide a callback function
//This makes sure people know how the items are being sorted, and the default method in Javascript is by unicode character value
