//The 'splice' method mutates arrays, which isn't good when you're trying to follow functional programming principles
//You can use the 'slice' method to achieve the same results as 'splice' by being a little creative and sometimes using other methods too
//This is an example of using 'slice' to do the same thing 'splice' would if it were given a first argument of '3'
