//I created my own '.map()' method!!
//The 'this' keyword really came in handy here, letting me refer to the object the method was called on
//Then the method used a for loop to iterate through all the items and push the items changed with the callback function to the new array
//I recreated the functionality of the '.map()' method using just a for loop and the '.push()' method! Woohoo!
