//This function utilizes the '.reduce()' method to average all the IMDB ratings of movies directed by Christopher Nolan
/* The reduce method is useful because it can compare 2 items against each other to analyze data, 
whereas filter and map can only do 1 at a time */
//I probably could have combined the 'nolanMovies' functionality with 'averageRating' to use only the '.reduce()' method for the problem
