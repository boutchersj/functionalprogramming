//The object that the map method iterated through was an object with several nested movie objects, each with several properties

//Instead of using a for loop that could change the original 'watchList' object, we use the map method to generate a new array 
//The new array is determined by the callback function inside the map method
//The map method iterates through the entire 'watchList' object and creates a new array using the instructions in the callback function
