/*The previous example didn't have any complicated operations 
but the splice method changed the original array, and resulted in a bug.

Recall that in functional programming, changing or altering things is called mutation, and the outcome is called a side effect. 
A function, ideally, should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause any side effects.

//This code doesn't change the global variable, 'fixedValue'
//It uses a function to achieve the same effect without mutating the variable
//This practice leads to fewer side effects
