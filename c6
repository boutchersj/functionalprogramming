//The object of this challenge was to refactor the original code to make sure the global variable, 'bookList', does not change
/* At first, this was very difficult for me. Yesterday, I stared at it for a straight hour wondering what I was doing wrong
because it seemed like it should have been so simple. 

I realized that it was a problem very similar to the other one I had involving slice and splice. If I want to use a copy of the original
array and NOT change the original array, I must save the copy to a variable. In this challenge, keywords 'let' or 'const' work equally.

I also realized that the challenge was set up in a misleading fashion and that ultimately I needed to change
all of the functions' code to make it work. That was eye-opening and I'll be aware of that possibility for future challenges. */

//The first function adds a book 'bookName' to the passed 'books' array and returns the new array
//The second function removes a book 'bookName' from the 'books' array and returns that new array
/* The second function doesn't actually remove the book from the passed array, 
it just concatenates the 2 parts of the array surrounding
the book 'bookName' so that 'bookName' is left out of the resulting array */
